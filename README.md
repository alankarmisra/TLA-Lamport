# Specifications for Leslie Lamport's TLA+ Video Course.

I made this repo for anyone following along with the video course on YouTube for one easy download. 
The playlist for the video course is available at:

## Opening the toolbox in the ToolBox IDE
I don't know about other platforms but on the Mac the open command seems broken. Instead, a very counter-intuitive way is to use 
```bash
Open Spec -> Add New Spec...
```
Browse to the folder where the .tla file is and then double click the tla file to have the same name appear in the Save as... field (or type it in). This will give you a warning saying it will replace the .tla file. 

_It actually won't replace the file at all_, so go ahead and confirm. 

This will then open the toolbox including the models.


The original video course along with errata is available at:

In the original video course (not YouTube), specification code will automatically appear below the video tutorial at the exact time Leslie references them and asks you to pause the video.
